### Next.js Version Update (Issue #9)

**Date**: 2025-12-03

**Issue**: #9 - Create Next.js 16 Project

**Note**: The original story was written when Next.js 15 was the latest version. As of December 2025, `create-next-app@latest` installs Next.js 16.0.7. The GitHub issue was updated to reflect this, and this is now the correct specification - not a workaround.

**Status**: Resolved - Issue #9 updated to specify Next.js 16

## Notes

- All workarounds should have a corresponding GitHub issue reference
- Review this document quarterly to check if workarounds can be removed
- When resolving a workaround, move it to the "Resolved / Not Applicable" section with resolution date and details
